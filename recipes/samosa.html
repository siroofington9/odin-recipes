                    <li><p>Boil potatoes just until done without making mushy.You can either boil them in a steamer,pot or a cooker.
                     </li></p>
                     
                    <li><p>Crumble them, do not mash them up. Set aside. 
                    </li></p>
                    
                    <li><p>Mix together flour, carom seeds, salt, and oil in a mixing bowl. 
                    </li></p>

                    <li><p>Rub the flour well for 2 to 3mins in between the palms to incorporate the oil or ghee well.
                    </li></p>

                    <li><p>Take handful of flour and press down with your
                        fingers.It must hold shape and not crumble.
                    </li></p>

                    <li><p>Add water little by little and mix the flour to form a stiff dough.It should be stiff and not soft dough. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins.
                    </li></p>

                    <li><p>Heat a pan with oil. Add cumin seeds.
                    </li></p>

                    <li><p>When they begins to sizzle, add ginger & fry until it smells good for about 30 to 60 seconds.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Next add green peas and saute for 2 mins.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, chaat masala (optional) & fennel powder. Saute for 30 seconds.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Next add potatoes and sprinkle salt. Mix and saute for 2 to 3 mins.Mix in coriander leaves & set aside to cool.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Taste and add more salt if needed. If using lemon juice, add it now.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Knead the dough gently to smoothen a bit. Make 5 portions and roll to balls. Cover the dough.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Grease the rolling area and then flatten a ball. Drizzle some oil.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Begin to roll to oval shape of 8.5 inches long by 6.5 inches wide. It should be neither too thick or too thin.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Cut it to two parts. The 2 parts make 2 samosas. If the edges are too thick, gently roll it to thin down.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Take one part and apply water over the straight edge (towards the cut side). Join the edges to make a cone. Press down gently to seal the cone from inside as well.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Fill the cone with potato masala and press down with your finger to push it inside the cone. Smear water generously on both the other edges.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Bring the edges together and seal them by pinching off the edges together. If you prefer to make a standing samosa, make a pleat on one side.Bring back the pleat and seal it by pinching off the edges together.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Make sure the samosa has been sealed wel. Cover them with a cloth to prevent drying.</li></p>

                    <li><p>After you make 5 samosas, begin to heat the oil until medium hot.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Oil has to be medium hot and not very hot. A piece of dough dropped in the oil should not sizzle or rise immediately. Instead you should see tiny bubbles in the oil & the dough should take a while to come up to the surface. This is the right temperature.</li></p>

                    <li><p>Gently add as many samosas as you can to the oil and fry them on a low flame undisturbed for few minutes (about 10 to 12 mins).</li></p>

                    <li><p>When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Rotate them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.</li></p>

                    <li><p>While the first batch of samosas fry, make the rest of them.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Remove the golden fried ones on to a colander. Let the temperature of oil come down slightly before you fry the next batch.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Serve samosa with mint chutney sweet tamarind chutney or tomato sauce.</p></li>
